              Since my childhood, I have been been passionate about ecology which made me hitchhike around Europe.
              The trigger for a real green change was the birth of my daughter, then I decided to act efficiently in my daily life.
              But I did not find the fun and data-driven solution to cut my carbon emissions so I started Greentastic with the team!

              After a one-year road trip around the world, I moved to New Delhi to work for Dr Pachauri, then director of the IPCC (GIEC).
              My 3 years in Indi are in forced my willingness to protec to the environment by all means.
              Since then, I've moved back to France and got involved in the Greentastic project which is the kind of solutions I'd belookingforas an employee to have a positive impact in my company.

              Currently in my final year of my engineering school in Toulouse, I met Charles at a Start-up Week-end Changemakers where we won prizes to launch Greentastic.
              I learned a lot about innovation and start-up during my internship @Bengs, an innovation consulting firm, and am excited to put them into practice to help Greentastic grow!

              I took part in several start-ups on the technical part like @Chouette. Greentastic is more than a professional project to me because the issue is global and all of us are concerned.
              As a full stack developer, my challenge is to create a user-friendly and fun to use app about a serious topic. And I love it!
